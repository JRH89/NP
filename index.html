        <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <p>
          I enjoy learning, creating, and solving; My curiosity is rarely satisified and I am constantly seeking ways to improve my skills and broaden my horizons.
        </p>

        <p>
          Video Game Development and Software Engineering are my two main areas of interest, however Web Design and Android App Development are other fields that I am currently studying and implementing into my projects. I have experience with Unreal Engine 4, Blender, Python, HTML, Java, XML, JavaScript, C++, SQL, and CSS.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am currently seeking a junior developer position in the video game or software industries. Check out some of my projects and certifications below...

          <li>
            <a href="https://jrh89.github.io/Portfolio/FallHollowLanding.html" style="color: white;" target="">Adventures In Fall Hollow (UE4)</a>
            <p>An action-adventure game made in Unreal Engine 4. Click the link above for screenshots and videos. Playable demos will be available upon request in the near future.</p>

        <h2>Recent Projects:</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/JRH89/Sorting-Hat-3.0" style="color: white"; target="_blank">Sorting Hat 3.0 Python Script</a>
            <p>Sorting Hat 3.0 is a Python executable that creates a GUI allowing the user to extract numbers from any input data and receive a sorted array as output as well as choose a type of graph to display the sorted data on (line, scatter, bar, histogram, pie). Makes use of the radiX sorting algorithm to quickly and efficently sort large sets of data. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Gxk6uAqsz7D6W7_r0uVNlCHnNFavWR4m/view?usp=sharing" style="color: goldenrod">Download Here</a></p>

          <li>
            <a href="https://jrh89.github.io/Weather-App" style="color: white"; target="_blank">Weather App</a>
            <p>This weather app utilizes the OpenWeather API to retrieve current weather data for any city and display it in a user-friendly format. I have also successfully built an APK that functions well on Android OS.</p>
          </li><br>
          <li>
            <a href="https://jrh89.github.io/ImprovedCovidCounter" style="color: white;" target="_blank">COVIDcounter</a>
            <p>COVIDcounter is a webpage that visualizes the number of confirmed cases, deaths, new cases, and mortality rate for almost every country using data from a public API. Because of the strict rate limiting on the data calls, this page is prone to displaying an eror. If enough people download it once it is on the Google Play store, I will subscribe to a paid tier API service to provide a better user experience.</p>
          </li><br>
           <li>
            <a href="https://jrh89.github.io/RobotSeahorse" style="color: white;" target="_blank">Robotic Seahorse JS Game</a>
            <p>Keyboard required. A 2D side-scroller game made with JavaScript where the player controls a robotic seahorse, shooting and defeating enemies with lasers to earn enough points before the timer runs out.</p>
          </li><br>
          <li>
            <a href="https://jrh89.github.io/DogGame" style="color: white;" target="_blank">Ghost Dog JS Game</a>
            <p>Keyboard required to play.  A simple JavaScript game where you play as a ghost dog trying to save the forest from evil creatures. Turn into a ball of fire and roll over or jump onto enemies to destroy them!</p>
          </li><br>
          <li>
            <a href="https://jrh89.github.io/ParticleText" style="color: white;" target="_blank">Interactive Particle Text</a>
            <p>This project is an interactive particle text effect made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Type something into the text bar and move your mouse cursor across the rendered text to send particles scattering before they return to their rightful places. This can be customized in thousands of ways to make it unique for many different applications.</p>
          </li><br>
          <li>
            <a href="https://jrh89.github.io/DrumKit" style="color: white;" target="_blank">Drum Kit</a>
            <p>Keyboard required. Not mobile friendly yet. A simple drum kit made with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, where you can play sounds by clicking or pressing the keyboard keys.</p>
